### **2. Image Understanding**
This image creates a powerful "then and now" comparison at a specific historical location. The old photograph likely depicts a dark period in history, possibly showing Nazi officials on the balcony of the Römer (City Hall) in Frankfurt, Germany. By juxtaposing this historical image with a modern-day pride flag at the exact same location, the creator makes a strong statement about progress, reclaiming public spaces from a history of intolerance, and celebrating diversity and freedom in the present.

### **3. User Understanding**
Yes, the viewer seemed to understand the image. Their gaze immediately focuses on the historical photograph being held, which is the central point of the composition's message. They spend the entire duration of the clip scanning the different figures on the balcony in the old photo, which is the crucial step in recognizing the historical context. By focusing intently on this "then" element, the viewer is gathering the necessary information to appreciate the stark and intentional contrast created by the pride flag and the present-day setting, thus grasping the image's core message.
