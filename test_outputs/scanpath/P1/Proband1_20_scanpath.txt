Stimulus Overview:
The image is a collage formatted as a meme, suggesting that the animated TV show "The Simpsons" predicted real-world events. It juxtaposes scenes from the show with real-life photographs. The top panels compare an animated Donald Trump with a real photo of Donald Trump, both with a young female activist in the background (Lisa Simpson and Greta Thunberg, respectively). The middle panels show Greta Thunberg giving a passionate speech and Lisa Simpson in a similar pose. The bottom panel displays a fictional newspaper from the show, the "Springfield Daily News," with a headline about a "pushy kid" cleaning up the town.

Behavioral Analysis:
The user's visual journey is focused on understanding the core claim of the meme. The scanpath begins at the bottom, focusing on the "Springfield" title of the newspaper. It then jumps to the top left to view the animated Trump, immediately followed by a saccade to the real Trump on the right, indicating a direct comparison. The gaze then drops to the animated Lisa Simpson at the podium before returning to the newspaper at the bottom. The user fixates first on the sub-headline "PUSHY KID NAGS TOWN" and then on the main headline "SPRINGFIELD CLEANS UP ACT". The user did not fixate on the image of Greta Thunberg. The overall pattern is not a simple reading scan but a series of comparative fixations between related elements to verify the meme's premise.

Key Insight:
The "Hero Element" is the newspaper at the bottom of the collage. The user began and ended their viewing session on this element, revisiting it to read both the main headline and the sub-headline. This indicates that the text on the newspaper was the most engaging component, serving as the central piece of "evidence" for the user in evaluating the meme's claim.
