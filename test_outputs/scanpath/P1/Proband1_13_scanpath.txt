Stimulus Overview:
The image is a still frame from an action scene, likely from an Indiana Jones movie. The protagonist, Indiana Jones, wearing his signature fedora, is seen in the middle of punching an antagonist dressed in a German military-style uniform from the World War II era. The fight takes place on what appears to be a military transport vehicle in a desert setting, with other soldiers visible in the background.

Behavioral Analysis:
The user's visual journey begins by immediately focusing on the central character, Indiana Jones. The gaze remains fixed on his face and upper torso for approximately three seconds, indicating a deep engagement with the protagonist and his action. Following this prolonged fixation, the user's attention shifts downward to the antagonist being struck, briefly fixating on his cap. This movement follows the logical flow of the punch. Finally, the gaze moves to the right to briefly inspect the metal grating on the floor of the vehicle, a quick scan of the environment where the action is unfolding.

Key Insight:
The "Hero Element" is clearly the character of Indiana Jones. The user dedicated the vast majority of their viewing time to this single element, suggesting their primary interest was in the protagonist's expression and physical action, rather than the antagonist or the surrounding environment.
