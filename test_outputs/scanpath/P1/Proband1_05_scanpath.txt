Stimulus Overview:
The image is a political cartoon depicting the conflict between Ukraine and Russia using the metaphor of a bullfight. In the foreground, a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acts as a matador, holding a Ukrainian flag like a muleta, facing a bull draped in the Russian flag. In the background, a crowd of caricatured world leaders, including Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, and others, watch from behind a wooden fence, positioned as spectators in an arena.

Behavioral Analysis:
The user's visual journey was focused on identifying the key political figures within the cartoon. The scanpath began on the centrally located caricature of U.S. President Joe Biden in the spectator crowd. The gaze then shifted left to another leader before moving down to the foreground to focus on the main protagonist, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Ukrainian flag he is holding. The viewing session concluded by jumping back up into the crowd to fixate on the caricature of former U.S. President Donald Trump. This pattern suggests the user was systematically identifying the main players and their depicted roles in the scene.

Key Insight:
The Hero Element is the caricature of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This figure, along with the Ukrainian flag he holds, serves as the central protagonist of the cartoon's action. It received focused attention after the initial orientation on the spectators, indicating a primary interest in the main subject of the narrative.
