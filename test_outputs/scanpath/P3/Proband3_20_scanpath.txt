Stimulus Overview:
The stimulus is a multi-panel meme drawing a comparison between the animated character Lisa Simpson and the climate activist Greta Thunberg. The top panels show both a cartoon and a real-life Donald Trump, with Lisa Simpson and Greta Thunberg respectively in the background. The middle panel shows Greta Thunberg giving a speech. The bottom panels feature Lisa Simpson giving a speech and a close-up of a newspaper from "The Simpsons" with the headline "SPRINGFIELD CLEANS UP ACT" and a sub-headline "PUSHY KID NAGS TOWN" next to a picture of Lisa. The overall theme suggests that "The Simpsons" predicted the real-world events and reactions surrounding youth climate activism.

Behavioral Analysis:
The user's visual journey begins by focusing on the image of Lisa Simpson speaking in the bottom panel. The gaze then jumps to the top of the image, briefly scanning the cartoon Trump before fixating on the real-life Donald Trump's face. The user then returns their gaze to the speaking Lisa Simpson in the bottom panel for a second fixation. Finally, the user moves their attention to the newspaper clipping in the bottom right, reading the main headline and then moving down to the sub-headline and the accompanying image of Lisa. The user is actively piecing together the comparison presented in the meme, using the characters as anchors before reading the text to understand the punchline.

Key Insight:
The hero element is the newspaper headline, specifically the sub-headline "PUSHY KID NAGS TOWN." While the user frequently revisited the image of Lisa Simpson, their visual journey culminates in reading the newspaper text. This element provides the crucial context and the core message of the meme—that the critical public reaction to a young female activist was foreshadowed in the show. The sustained attention on this text at the end of the viewing period indicates it was the most significant element for comprehension.
