Stimulus Overview:
The image is a meme featuring a photograph of a rustic wooden structure, likely an animal enclosure. In the foreground, a sign displays a pictogram of a hand feeding a goat, which is crossed out with a red line, indicating "Do not feed the animals." At the top of the image, there is German text that reads, "Bitte mit den Ziegen nicht italienisch sprechen," which translates to "Please do not speak Italian with the goats." The humor arises from the absurd textual misinterpretation of the standard visual warning sign.

Behavioral Analysis:
The user’s visual journey begins with an immediate fixation on the pictogram sign in the foreground, specifically on the interaction between the hand and the goat. The gaze then moves upwards to read the text overlay, scanning the words "italienisch sprechen" ("speak Italian"). After processing the text, the user's attention returns to the sign, indicating a comparison between the text they just read and the visual information. This scanpath shows the user attempting to connect the absurd caption with the actual meaning of the sign to understand the joke.

Key Insight:
The hero element is the pictogram sign prohibiting feeding the goats. It captures the initial and final points of significant focus. The user's repeated return to the sign after reading the caption highlights its central role in the meme's humor; it is the visual anchor that makes the unrelated text funny.
