Stimulus Overview:
The image displays a dimly lit living room with an eclectic, bohemian decor style. The scene is characterized by a prominent gallery wall with numerous framed pictures and mirrors, a plush green velvet sofa adorned with pillows, and a wooden coffee table with lit candles. Floating shelves on the wall hold various decorative items, and a large potted plant is visible to the right, all contributing to a warm and cozy atmosphere.

Behavioral Analysis:
The user's visual journey is exploratory, focusing on specific decorative details rather than the overall composition. The gaze initially lands on a patterned, circular object on the gallery wall. It then moves down to the pillows on the green sofa, before briefly fixating on a lit candle on the coffee table. The user's attention returns to the sofa area and then travels upwards to the shelves, where it comes to rest on a small object on the highest shelf. This pattern suggests an interest in the individual items that create the room's unique style.

Key Insight:
The Hero Element is the small, light-colored figurine on the top shelf. Despite the sofa being the largest object and the candles being a light source, the user's gaze ultimately settles on this small, specific decorative piece for the longest duration, indicating it was the most engaging detail in the scene for them.
