### **Image Understanding**

This image captures a classic and humorous classroom moment of a student being caught goofing off. The student has drawn a simple caricature of their professor in MS Paint, and the professor is now standing directly behind them, seemingly on the verge of discovering the drawing. The humor is derived from this tense, relatable "about to be busted" situation and the comical, low-effort nature of the digital doodle.
